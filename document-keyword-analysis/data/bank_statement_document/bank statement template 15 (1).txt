The life expectancy factor used is based on both your date of birth and the  \r\nbeneficiary information we have on file as of December 31st of the prioryear. \r\nPlease     contact     Fidelity    if     there     is    a     change     in    your     beneficiary \r\ninformationasthiscalculation will not be updated until the calendar year following \r\nthe year in which you change your beneficiarydesignation. \r\n\r\nYear-to-Date distributions include any distributions taken after January  \r\n1stofthecurrent year through midnight of the statement enddate. \r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to satisfy IRS minimum distribution requirements. \r\nLearn more about MRD s atwww.Fidelity.com/RDCor call a  \r\nFidelityrepresentative at the number listed on the front of your statement. \r\nIf you need specific tax advice be sure to consult with your taxadviser. \r\n\r\nEAI for fixed rate domestic bonds and CDs is calculated using the coupon rate.  \r\nFor all other securities, EAI is calculated using an indicated  \r\nannualdividend(IAD).The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for  \r\nthe next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that  \r\nsecurity. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no  \r\nassurance can be made as to accuracy. This third party data may not be promptly \r\nupdated to reflect various corporate actions (for example, when an issuer has  \r\nmissed a scheduled dividend payment, announced changes to a payment  \r\nschedule, or declared a stock split) and, as a result, the EAI and EY may be over  \r\nor understated. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and  \r\nmay be affected by current and future economic, political and business  \r\nconditions.Please refer to the Help/Glossary on Fidelity.com for additional  \r\ninformation regarding these calculations. \r\n\r\nEAI and EY are not provided for:preferred stocks, exchange traded products \r\n(ETFs & ETNs), UITs, variable rate bonds, and international stocks & bonds, but \r\nmay be  included in the future.
