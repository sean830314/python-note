""""
Letâ€™s say that you want to build a news website and you want to show different content for different users. You want to give paid users full access to articles, without any ads. At the same time, you want to give free users some excerpts from the articles, with some ads on the page. Finally, you want to show a call to action to all free users, so you can hopefully convert them to paid users.


Client 	        Interface 	        Implementation
the user 	the UI of the website 	what it's drawn in each UI component

The Interface is the UI of website. There are free users and paid users, so there are two interfaces to build: one with ads, excerpts and a call to action (free version) and another one with full articles (paid version).
